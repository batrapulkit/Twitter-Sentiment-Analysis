# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project implements sentiment analysis on Twitter data to determine the general sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in tweets. Using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the model is trained on a dataset of tweets and then used to predict the sentiment of new tweets in real time.
